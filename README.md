Applies Business Intelligence (BI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to optimize last-mile logistics operations using the Last Miles Dataset. It aims to enhance delivery efficiency, reduce operational costs, and improve customer satisfaction. The project addresses key challenges faced by GoLogistics, including rising delivery expenses, delays due to traffic and inefficient route planning, and the underutilization of delivery partner resources.
